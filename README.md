## Project Description

This is a fork of (the original repository)[https://github.com/s-ccs/BSc2024_AR-EEG] to capture the final state of the progress of the thesis. Refer to the original repository for the most recent updates and documentation.

This project is an application for the Hololens 2 that can be used to visualize data from an EEG cap in the operator’s view. It aims at helping the operator prepare an EEG cap on a patient’s head to achieve high-quality measurements.

The major goal is to implement a tool for the Microsoft HoloLens, which receives the measured impedance values of the electrodes and visualizes them for the operator preparing the cap. The operator can see impedance values as rings arounf each electrode, which removes the need to look at a separate device.
